              <p>Admittedly, it's kind of hard to motivate yourself to keep learning especially when there are no assignments! That's why we have collected these resources for you all. Many of these links include cool and engaging ways to learn things. And of course, here we've only listed common subjects taken by high schoolers, but your learning is not limited to these things.</p>
              <p>
                For example, now is a great time to learn how to cook! Learn how to play a new musical instrument. Start DJing (free software available online). Pick up a new sport (many of which you can play in your back yard). Learn a new language!
              </p>
              <p> Here's a list of stuff you can do to fill your days that are also educational in their own way.
                <ul>
                  <li> <b>Read books</b>. Check out websites like <a href="www.goodreads.com" target="_blank">Goodreads</a> where you can keep track of what you read and look at lists of what other people recommend! There is something for everybody.

                  <li> <b>Write a novel, Make a blog, Just Write!!</b> There are several resources for this: <a href="https://medium.com/creators" target="_blank">Medium</a>, <a href="https://blogger.com" target="_blank">Google's Blogger</a>

                  <li> <b>Make a website for yourself </b> Look into <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">gh-pages</a> and <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, and <a href="https://www.wix.com/" target="_blank">Wix</a>.

                  <li><b> Learn how to cook </b>
                  <li><b> Pick up a new language </b>. A great way to do this is to do a few quick grammar and vocab lessons for the language then consume media in the language. For example, if you want to learn French, listen to French music! Watch French movies and tv-shows!

              <h3>Free College Application Resources</h3>

              <p>The following is a collection of online resources that students from low-income and disadvantage backgrounds can look into for support. All of these resources are free and national.</p>
              <br/>

                <h4>Fee Waivers for Exams and Applications</h4>
                <p>A student may spend around a thousand dollars in application and examination fees while applying to colleges. The following is a compilation of resources on how to waive certain fees if you are seeking to alleviate this financial burden.</p>
                <p>DISCLAIMER about Exams during Covid-19: Exams for the Spring have been canceled (see <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/dates-deadlines">SAT</a> and <a href="https://www.act.org/content/act/en/covid-19.html">ACT</a> site for example). However, take advantage of the online resources and feel free to ask your school counselors through email about future access to these resources if you have not already.</p>

                  <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/FeeWaiver.pdf">ACT Fee Waiver</a></h5>
                  <ul><li>Forms are available through your school or Upward Bound Center. You cannot apply for the fee waiver independently.</li>
                    <ul><li>If you have a guidance/college guidance office. that should be your best bet at getting one.</li>
                    <li>If they do not have them, ask them to order them. (They can visit <a href="https://www.act.org/the-act/supportmaterials">www.act.org/the-act/supportmaterials</a> to order them.)</li></ul>
                  <li>Included in the waiver:</li>
                    <ul><li>TWO chances at the ACT without charge (one per waiver)</li>
                    <li>FREE Access to their prep online (Usually $40+)</li></ul></ul>

                  <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/pdf/sat-fee-waiver-student-brochure.pdf">SAT Fee Waiver</a></h5>
                  <ul><li>Forms are available through your school. You cannot apply for the fee waiver independently.</li>
                    <ul><li>You must be in grades 11/12 to receive a Fee Waiver.</li>
                    <li>If your counselor does not provide Fee Waivers, they can learn how to request them <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/k12-educators/advising-instruction/requesting-fee-waivers">here</a> and can directly call 888-SAT-HELP for assistance.</li></ul>
                  <li>Included in the waiver:</li>
                    <ul><li>Waivers cover: 2 free SATs (with or without the essay), 6 free SAT Subject Tests, 2 free Question-and-Answer Service (QAS) or Student Answer Service (SAS) reports.</li>
                    <li>Unlimited score reports to colleges</li>
                    <li>They publicize <a href="https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/applying-101/college-application-fee-waivers/participating-colleges">college application fee waivers</a>, but some participating colleges already have their own waiving process. After taking an exam with a fee waiver, students will get application waivers in the mail.</li></ul>
                  <li><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/sat">Khan Academy</a> provides free online test prep for the SAT.</li></ul>

                <br/>
                <h4>Mentorship and Guidance</h4>
                <p>Mentorship and guidance is key to being successful in the admissions process. Even if you have the support of your in-school teachers and counselors it is always helpful to get outside opinions on essay-writing, school selection and reading financial aid packages.</p>

                  <h5><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/college-careers-more/college-admissions" style="text-decoration: underline;">KhanAcademy</a> Resource Page</h5>
                    <ul><li>This webpage is not a replacement for a counselor, but for a student it is a good starting point. Read it through to understand the process better.</li></ul>

                  <h5><a href="https://www.collegepoint.info/" style="text-decoration: underline;">Collegepoint.info</a></h5>
                    <ul><li>This is specifically for low-income students. It is free advising on essays, college searching, reading financial aid packages, and also provides scholarships for applying to schools. You can join as a junior or senior.</li>
                    <li>A personal blog post about it if you want an account of how this worked out for one student: <a href="www.jtjan.me/student-opportunities/collegepointinfo">www.jtjan.me/student-opportunities/collegepointinfo</a></li></ul>

                  <h5><a href="http://www.matriculate.org/college" style="text-decoration: underline;">Matriculate</a></h5>
                    <ul><li>This is a similar program to Collegepoint.info. In the same way, they also connect high achieving, low-income students to counselors for their college seeking process starting in junior year for no cost to the student.</li>
                    <li>The difference between Collegepoint.info and Matriculate is that you <em>must</em> be in Junior year and have taken either the ACT or the SAT to register for Matriculate. While this may be a higher barrier, they have a more streamlined process.</li></ul>

                  <h5><a href="http://www.coved.org/" style="text-decoration: underline;">CovEd</a></h5>
